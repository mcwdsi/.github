🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

**This GitHub organization is the place for the repositories of the Data Science Institute at the Medical College of Wisconsin.**

The DSI is both a department and a center, and has primary faculty, the ability to create and operate graduate programs, and the ability to create and offer services to the entire institution. The DSI began August 1, 2023 with the arrival of Dr. William Hogan.  Many of the repositories are his repos transferred from the UFBMI GitHub organization.
